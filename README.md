# option_pricer
pricing different kind of options through a variety of methods

At the moment, the option pricer is restricted to European call and put options. I use three different methods to price:
1- analytic evaluation through Black-Scholes-Merton formula. This is mainly to judge the accuracy of the other methods.
2- Monte Carlo
3- Binomial tree
